contracted to thine own bright eyes   feedst thy lights flame with selfsubstantial fuel   making a famine where abundance lies   thy self thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel   thou that art now the worlds fresh ornament   and only herald to the gaudy spring   within thine own bud buriest thy content   and tender churl makst waste in niggarding     pity the world or else this glutton be     to eat the worlds due by the grave and thee   when forty winters shall besiege thy brow   and dig deep trenches in thy beautys field   thy youths proud livery so gazed on now   will be a tatterd weed of small worth held   then being asked where all thy beauty lies   where all the treasure of thy lusty days   to say within thine own deep sunken eyes   were an alleating shame and thriftless praise   how much more praise deservd thy beautys use   if thou couldst answer this fair child of mine   shall sum my count and make my old excuse   proving his beauty by succession thine     this were to be new made when thou art old     and see thy blood warm when thou feelst it cold   look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest   now is the time that face should form another   whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest   thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother   for where is she so fair whose uneard womb   disdains the tillage of thy husbandry   or who is he so fond will be the tomb   of his selflove to stop posterity   thou art thy mothers glass and she in thee   calls back the lovely april of her prime   so thou through windows of thine age shalt see   despite of wrinkles this thy golden time     but if thou live rememberd not to be     die single and thine image dies with thee   unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend   upon thy self thy beautys legacy   natures bequest gives nothing but doth lend   and being frank she lends to those are free   then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse   the bounteous largess given thee to give   profitless usurer why dost thou use   so great a sum of sums yet canst not live   for having traffic with thy self alone   thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive   then how when nature calls thee to be gone   what acceptable audit canst thou leave     thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee     which used lives th executor to be   those hours that with gentle work did frame   the lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell   will play the tyrants to the very same   and that unfair which fairly doth excel   for neverresting time leads summer on   to hideous winter and confounds him there   sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone   beauty oersnowed and bareness every where   then were not summers distillation left   a liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass   beautys effect with beauty were bereft   nor it nor no remembrance what it was     but flowers distilld though they with winter meet     leese but their show their substance still lives sweet   then let not winters ragged hand deface   in thee thy

loan   thats for thy self to breed another thee   or ten times happier be it ten for one   ten times thy self were happier than thou art   if ten of thine ten times refigurd thee   then what could death do if thou shouldst depart   leaving thee living in posterity     be not selfwilld for thou art much too fair     to be deaths conquest and make worms thine heir   lo in the orient when the gracious light   lifts up his burning head each under eye   doth homage to his newappearing sight   serving with looks his sacred majesty   and having climbd the steepup heavenly hill   resembling strong youth in his middle age   yet mortal looks adore his beauty still   attending on his golden pilgrimage   but when from highmost pitch with weary car   like feeble age he reeleth from the day   the eyes fore duteous now converted are   from his low tract and look another way     so thou thyself outgoing in thy noon     unlookd on diest unless thou get a son   music to hear why hearst thou music sadly   sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy   why lovst thou that which thou receivst not gladly   or else receivst with pleasure thine annoy   if the true concord of welltuned sounds   by unions married do offend thine ear   they do but sweetly chide thee who confounds   in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear   mark how one string sweet husband to another   strikes each in each by mutual ordering   resembling sire and child and happy mother   who all in one one pleasing note do sing     whose speechless song being many seeming one     sings this to thee thou single wilt prove none   is it for fear to wet a widows eye   that thou consumst thy self in single life   ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die   the world will wail thee like a makeless wife   the world will be thy widow and still weep   that thou no form of thee hast left behind   when every private widow well may keep   by childrens eyes her husbands shape in mind   look what an unthrift in the world doth spend   shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it   but beautys waste hath in the world an end   and kept unused the user so destroys it     no love toward others in that bosom sits     that on himself such murdrous shame commits   for shame deny that thou bearst love to any   who for thy self art so unprovident   grant if thou wilt thou art belovd of many   but that thou none lovst is most evident   for thou art so possessd with murderous hate   that gainst thy self thou stickst not to conspire   seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate   which to repair should be thy chief desire   o change thy thought that i may change my mind   shall hate be fairer lodgd than gentle love   be as thy presence is gracious and kind   or to thyself at least kindhearted prove     make thee another self for love of me     that beauty still may live in thine or thee   as fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou growst   in one of thine from that which thou departest   and that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowst   thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest   herein lives wisdom beauty and increase   without this folly age and cold decay   if all were minded so the times should cease   and threescore year would make the world away   let those whom nature hath not made for store   harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish   look whom she best endowd she gave thee more   which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish     she carvd thee for her seal and meant thereby     thou shouldst print more not let that copy die   when i do count the clock that tells the time   and see the brave day sunk in hideous night   when i behold the violet past prime   and sable curls all silvered oer with white   when lofty trees i see barren of leaves   which erst from heat did canopy the herd   and summers green all girded up in sheaves   borne on the bier with white and bristly beard   then of thy beauty do i question make   that thou among the wastes of time must go   since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake   and die as fast as they see others grow     and nothing gainst times scythe can make defence     save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence   o that you were your self but love you are   no longer yours than you your self here live   against this coming end you should prepare   and your sweet semblance to some other give   so should that beauty which you hold in lease   find no determination then you were   yourself again after yourselfs decease   when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear   who lets so fair a house fall to decay   which husbandry in honour might uphold   against the stormy gusts of winters day   and barren rage of deaths eternal cold     o none but unthrifts dear my love you know     you had a father let your son say so   not from the stars do i my judgement pluck   and yet methinks i have astronomy   but not to tell of good or evil luck   of plagues of dearths or seasons quality   nor can i fortune to brief minutes tell   pointing to each his thunder rain and wind   or say with princes if it shall go well   by oft predict that i in heaven find   but from thine eyes my knowledge i derive   and constant stars in them i read such art   as truth and beauty shall together thrive   if from thyself to store thou wouldst convert     or else of thee this i prognosticate     thy end is truths and beautys doom and date   when i consider every thing that grows   holds in perfection but a little moment   that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows   whereon the stars in secret influence comment   when i perceive that men as plants increase   cheered and checked even by the selfsame sky   vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease   and wear their brave state out of memory   then the conceit of this inconstant stay   sets you most rich in youth before my sight   where wasteful time debateth with decay   to change your day of youth to sullied night     and all in war with time for love of you     as he takes from you i engraft you new   but wherefore do not you a mightier way   make war upon this bloody tyrant time   and fortify your self in your decay   with means more blessed than my barren rhyme   now stand you on the top of happy hours   and many maiden gardens yet unset   with virtuous wish would bear you living flowers   much liker than your painted counterfeit   so should the lines of life that life repair   which this times pencil or my pupil pen   neither in inward worth nor outward fair   can make you live your self in eyes of men     to give away yourself keeps yourself still     and you must live drawn by your own sweet skill   who will believe my verse in time to come   if it were filld with your most high deserts   though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb   which hides your life and shows not half your parts   if i could write the beauty of your eyes   and in fresh numbers number all your graces   the age to come would say this poet lies   such heavenly touches neer touchd earthly faces   so should my papers yellowd with their age   be scornd like old men of less truth than tongue   and your true rights be termd a poets rage   and stretched metre of an antique song     but were some child of yours alive that time     you should live twicein it and in my rhyme   shall i compare thee to a summers day   thou art more lovely and more temperate   rough winds do shake the darling buds of may   and summers lease hath all too short a date   sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines   and often is his gold complexion dimmd   and every fair from fair sometime declines   by chance or natures changing course untrimmd   but thy eternal summer shall not fade   nor lose possession of that fair thou owst   nor shall death brag thou wanderst in his shade   when in eternal lines to time thou growst     so long as men can breathe or eyes can see     so long lives this and this gives life to thee   devouring time blunt thou the lions paws   and make the earth devour her own sweet brood   pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tigers jaws   and burn the longlivd phoenix in her blood   make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets   and do whateer thou wilt swiftfooted time   to the wide world and all her fading sweets   but i forbid thee one most heinous crime   o carve not with thy hours my loves fair brow   nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen   him in thy course untainted do allow   for beautys pattern to succeeding men     yet do thy worst old time despite thy wrong     my love shall in my verse ever live young   a womans face with natures own hand painted   hast thou the master mistress of my passion   a womans gentle heart but not acquainted   with shifting change as is false womens fashion   an eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling   gilding the object whereupon it gazeth   a man in hue all hues in his controlling   which steals mens eyes and womens souls amazeth   and for a woman wert thou first created   till nature as she wrought thee fell adoting   and by addition me of thee defeated   by adding one thing to my purpose nothing     but since she prickd thee out for womens pleasure     mine be thy love and thy loves use their treasure   so is it not with me as with that muse   stirrd by a painted beauty to his verse   who heaven itself for ornament doth use   and every fair with his fair doth rehearse   making a couplement of proud compare   with sun and moon with earth and seas rich gems   with aprils firstborn flowers and all things rare   that heavens air in this huge rondure hems   o let me true in love but truly write   and then believe me my love is as fair   as any mothers child though not so bright   as those gold candles fixd in heavens air     let them say more that like of hearsay well     i will not praise that purpose not to sell   my glass shall not persuade me i am old   so long as youth and thou are of one date   but when in thee times furrows i behold   then look i death my days should expiate   for all that beauty that doth cover thee   is but the seemly raiment of my heart   which in thy breast doth live as thine in me   how can i then be elder than thou art   o therefore love be of thyself so wary   as i not for myself but for thee will   bearing thy heart which i will keep so chary   as tender nurse her babe from faring ill     presume not on thy heart when mine is slain     thou gavst me thine not to give back again   as an unperfect actor on the stage   who with his fear is put beside his part   or some fierce thing replete with too much rage   whose strengths abundance weakens his own heart   so i for fear of trust forget to say   the perfect ceremony of loves rite   and in mine own loves strength seem to decay   oerchargd with burthen of mine own loves might   o let my looks be then the eloquence   and dumb presagers of my speaking breast   who plead for love and look for recompense   more than that tongue that more hath more expressd     o learn to read what silent love hath writ     to hear with eyes belongs to loves fine wit   mine eye hath playd the painter and hath stelld   thy beautys form in table of my heart   my body is the frame wherein tis held   and perspective it is best painters art   for through the painter must you see his skill   to find where your true image picturd lies   which in my bosoms shop is hanging still   that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes   now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done   mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me   are windows to my breast wherethrough the sun   delights to peep to gaze therein on thee     yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art     they draw but what they see know not the heart   let those who are in favour with their stars   of public honour and proud titles boast   whilst i whom fortune of such triumph bars   unlookd for joy in that i honour most   great princes favourites their fair leaves spread   but as the marigold at the suns eye   and in themselves their pride lies buried   for at a frown they in their glory die   the painful warrior famoused for fight   after a thousand victories once foild   is from the book of honour razed quite   and all the rest forgot for which he toild     then happy i that love and am belovd     where i may not remove nor be removd   lord of my love to whom in vassalage   thy merit hath my duty strongly knit   to thee i send this written embassage   to witness duty not to show my wit   duty so great which wit so poor as mine   may make seem bare in wanting words to show it   but that i hope some good conceit of thine   in thy souls thought all naked will bestow it   till whatsoever star that guides my moving   points on me graciously with fair aspect   and puts apparel on my tatterd loving   to show me worthy of thy sweet respect     then may i dare to boast how i do love thee     till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me   weary with toil i haste me to my bed   the dear respose for limbs with travel tird   but then begins a journey in my head   to work my mind when bodys works expired   for then my thoughtsfrom far where i abide   intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee   and keep my drooping eyelids open wide   looking on darkness which the blind do see   save that my souls imaginary sight   presents thy shadow to my sightless view   which like a jewel hung in ghastly night   makes black night beauteous and her old face new     lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind     for thee and for myself no quiet find   how can i then return in happy plight   that am debarred the benefit of rest   when days oppression is not easd by night   but day by night and night by day oppressd   and each though enemies to eithers reign   do in consent shake hands to torture me   the one by toil the other to complain   how far i toil still farther off from thee   i tell the day to please him thou art bright   and dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven   so flatter i the swartcomplexiond night   when sparkling stars twire not thou gildst the even     but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer     and night doth nightly make griefs length seem stronger   when in disgrace with fortune and mens eyes   i all alone beweep my outcast state   and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries   and look upon myself and curse my fate   wishing me like to one more rich in hope   featurd like him like him with friends possessd   desiring this mans art and that mans scope   with what i most enjoy contented least   yet in these thoughts my self almost despising   haply i think on thee and then my state   like to the lark at break of day arising   from sullen earth sings hymns at heavens gate     for thy sweet love rememberd such wealth brings     that then i scorn to change my state with kings   when to the sessions of sweet silent thought   i summon up remembrance of things past   i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought   and with old woes new wail my dear times waste   then can i drown an eye unused to flow   for precious friends hid in deaths dateless night   and weep afresh loves long since cancelld woe   and moan the expense of many a vanishd sight   then can i grieve at grievances foregone   and heavily from woe to woe tell oer   the sad account of forebemoaned moan   which i new pay as if not paid before     but if the while i think on thee dear friend     all losses are restord and sorrows end   thy bosom is endeared with all hearts   which i by lacking have supposed dead   and there reigns love and all loves loving parts   and all those friends which i thought buried   how many a holy and obsequious tear   hath dear religious love stoln from mine eye   as interest of the dead which now appear   but things removd that hidden in thee lie   thou art the grave where buried love doth live   hung with the trophies of my lovers gone   who all their parts of me to thee did give   that due of many now is thine alone     their images i lovd i view in thee     and thouall theyhast all the all of me   if thou survive my wellcontented day   when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover   and shalt by fortune once more resurvey   these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover   compare them with the bettring of the time   and though they be outstrippd by every pen   reserve them for my love not for their rhyme   exceeded by the height of happier men   o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought   had my friends muse grown with this growing age   a dearer birth than this his love had brought   to march in ranks of better equipage     but since he died and poets better prove     theirs for their style ill read his for his love   full many a glorious morning have i seen   flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye   kissing with golden face the meadows green   gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy   anon permit the basest clouds to ride   with ugly rack on his celestial face   and from the forlorn world his visage hide   stealing unseen to west with this disgrace   even so my sun one early morn did shine   with all triumphant splendour on my brow   but out alack he was but one hour mine   the region cloud hath maskd him from me now     yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth     suns of the world may stain when heavens sun staineth   why didst thou promise such a beauteous day   and make me travel forth without my cloak   to let base clouds oertake me in my way   hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke   tis not enough that through the cloud thou break   to dry the rain on my stormbeaten face   for no man well of such a salve can speak   that heals the wound and cures not the disgrace   nor can thy shame give physic to my grief   though thou repent yet i have still the loss   the offenders sorrow lends but weak relief   to him that bears the strong offences cross     ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds     and they are rich and ransom all ill deeds   no more be grievd at that which thou hast done   roses have thorns and silver fountains mud   clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun   and loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud   all men make faults and even i in this   authorizing thy trespass with compare   myself corrupting salving thy amiss   excusing thy sins more than thy sins are   for to thy sensual fault i bring in sense   thy adverse party is thy advocate   and gainst myself a lawful plea commence   such civil war is in my love and hate     that i an accessary needs must be     to that sweet thief which sourly robs from me   let me confess that we two must be twain   although our undivided loves are one   so shall those blots that do with me remain   without thy help by me be borne alone   in our two loves there is but one respect   though in our lives a separable spite   which though it alter not loves sole effect   yet doth it steal sweet hours from loves delight   i may not evermore acknowledge thee   lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame   nor thou with public kindness honour me   unless thou take that honour from thy name     but do not so i love thee in such sort     as thou being mine mine is thy good report   as a decrepit father takes delight   to see his active child do deeds of youth   so i made lame by fortunes dearest spite   take all my comfort of thy worth and truth   for whether beauty birth or wealth or wit   or any of these all or all or more   entitled in thy parts do crowned sit   i make my love engrafted to this store   so then i am not lame poor nor despisd   whilst that this shadow doth such substance give   that i in thy abundance am sufficd   and by a part of all thy glory live     look what is best that best i wish in thee     this wish i have then ten times happy me   how can my muse want subject to invent   while thou dost breathe that pourst into my verse   thine own sweet argument too excellent   for every vulgar paper to rehearse   o give thy self the thanks if aught in me   worthy perusal stand against thy sight   for whos so dumb that cannot write to thee   when thou thy self dost give invention light   be thou the tenth muse ten times more in worth   than those old nine which rhymers invocate   and he that calls on thee let him bring forth   eternal numbers to outlive long date     if my slight muse do please these curious days     the pain be mine but thine shall be the praise   o how thy worth with manners may i sing   when thou art all the better part of me   what can mine own praise to mine own self bring   and what ist but mine own when i praise thee   even for this let us divided live   and our dear love lose name of single one   that by this separation i may give   that due to thee which thou deservst alone   o absence what a torment wouldst thou prove   were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave   to entertain the time with thoughts of love   which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive     and that thou teachest how to make one twain     by praising him here who doth hence remain   take all my loves my love yea take them all   what hast thou then more than thou hadst before   no love my love that thou mayst true love call   all mine was thine before thou hadst this more   then if for my love thou my love receivest   i cannot blame thee for my love thou usest   but yet be blamd if thou thy self deceivest   by wilful taste of what thyself refusest   i do forgive thy robbery gentle thief   although thou steal thee all my poverty   and yet love knows it is a greater grief   to bear loves wrong than hates known injury     lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows     kill me with spites yet we must not be foes   those pretty wrongs that liberty commits   when i am sometime absent from thy heart   thy beauty and thy years full well befits   for still temptation follows where thou art   gentle thou art and therefore to be won   beauteous thou art therefore to be assaild   and when a woman woos what womans son   will sourly leave her till he have prevaild   ay me but yet thou mightst my seat forbear   and chide thy beauty and thy straying youth   who lead thee in their riot even there   where thou art forced to break a twofold truth     hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee     thine by thy beauty being false to me   that thou hast her it is not all my grief   and yet it may be said i loved her dearly   that she hath thee is of my wailing chief   a loss in love that touches me more nearly   loving offenders thus i will excuse ye   thou dost love her because thou knowst i love her   and for my sake even so doth she abuse me   suffering my friend for my sake to approve her   if i lose thee my loss is my loves gain   and losing her my friend hath found that loss   both find each other and i lose both twain   and both for my sake lay on me this cross     but heres the joy my friend and i are one     sweet flattery then she loves but me alone   when most i wink then do mine eyes best see   for all the day they view things unrespected   but when i sleep in dreams they look on thee   and darkly bright are bright in dark directed   then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright   how would thy shadows form form happy show   to the clear day with thy much clearer light   when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so   how would i say mine eyes be blessed made   by looking on thee in the living day   when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade   through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay     all days are nights to see till i see thee     and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me   if the dull substance of my flesh were thought   injurious distance should not stop my way   for then despite of space i would be brought   from limits far remote where thou dost stay   no matter then although my foot did stand   upon the farthest earth removd from thee   for nimble thought can jump both sea and land   as soon as think the place where he would be   but ah thought kills me that i am not thought   to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone   but that so much of earth and water wrought   i must attend times leisure with my moan     receiving nought by elements so slow     but heavy tears badges of eithers woe   the other two slight air and purging fire   are both with thee wherever i abide   the first my thought the other my desire   these presentabsent with swift motion slide   for when these quicker elements are gone   in tender embassy of love to thee   my life being made of four with two alone   sinks down to death oppressd with melancholy   until lifes composition be recurd   by those swift messengers returnd from thee   who even but now come back again assurd   of thy fair health recounting it to me     this told i joy but then no longer glad     i send them back again and straight grow sad   mine eye and heart are at a mortal war   how to divide the conquest of thy sight   mine eye my heart thy pictures sight would bar   my heart mine eye the freedom of that right   my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie   a closet never piercd with crystal eyes   but the defendant doth that plea deny   and says in him thy fair appearance lies   to side this title is impannelled   a quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart   and by their verdict is determined   the clear eyes moiety and the dear hearts part     as thus mine eyes due is thy outward part     and my hearts right thy inward love of heart   betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took   and each doth good turns now unto the other   when that mine eye is famishd for a look   or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother   with my loves picture then my eye doth feast   and to the painted banquet bids my heart   another time mine eye is my hearts guest   and in his thoughts of love doth share a part   so either by thy picture or my love   thy self away art present still with me   for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move   and i am still with them and they with thee     or if they sleep thy picture in my sight     awakes my heart to hearts and eyes delight   how careful was i when i took my way   each trifle under truest bars to thrust   that to my use it might unused stay   from hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust   but thou to whom my jewels trifles are   most worthy comfort now my greatest grief   thou best of dearest and mine only care   art left the prey of every vulgar thief   thee have i not lockd up in any chest   save where thou art not though i feel thou art   within the gentle closure of my breast   from whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part     and even thence thou wilt be stoln i fear     for truth proves thievish for a prize so dear   against that time if ever that time come   when i shall see thee frown on my defects   when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum   calld to that audit by advisd respects   against that time when thou shalt strangely pass   and scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye   when love converted from the thing it was   shall reasons find of settled gravity   against that time do i ensconce me here   within the knowledge of mine own desert   and this my hand against my self uprear   to guard the lawful reasons on thy part     to leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws     since why to love i can allege no cause   how heavy do i journey on the way   when what i seek my weary travels end   doth teach that ease and that repose to say   thus far the miles are measured from thy friend   the beast that bears me tired with my woe   plods dully on to bear that weight in me   as if by some instinct the wretch did know   his rider lovd not speed being made from thee   the bloody spur cannot provoke him on   that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide   which heavily he answers with a groan   more sharp to me than spurring to his side     for that same groan doth put this in my mind     my grief lies onward and my joy behind   thus can my love excuse the slow offence   of my dull bearer when from thee i speed   from where thou art why should i haste me thence   till i return of posting is no need   o what excuse will my poor beast then find   when swift extremity can seem but slow   then should i spur though mounted on the wind   in winged speed no motion shall i know   then can no horse with my desire keep pace   therefore desire of perfectst love being made   shall neighno dull fleshin his fiery race   but love for love thus shall excuse my jade     since from thee going he went wilfulslow     towards thee ill run and give him leave to go   so am i as the rich whose blessed key   can bring him to his sweet uplocked treasure   the which he will not every hour survey   for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure   therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare   since seldom coming in that long year set   like stones of worth they thinly placed are   or captain jewels in the carcanet   so is the time that keeps you as my chest   or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide   to make some special instant specialblest   by new unfolding his imprisond pride     blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope     being had to triumph being lacked to hope   what is your substance whereof are you made   that millions of strange shadows on you tend   since every one hath every one one shade   and you but one can every shadow lend   describe adonis and the counterfeit   is poorly imitated after you   on helens cheek all art of beauty set   and you in grecian tires are painted new   speak of the spring and foison of the year   the one doth shadow of your beauty show   the other as your bounty doth appear   and you in every blessed shape we know     in all external grace you have some part     but you like none none you for constant heart   o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem   by that sweet ornament which truth doth give   the rose looks fair but fairer we it deem   for that sweet odour which doth in it live   the canker blooms have full as deep a dye   as the perfumed tincture of the roses   hang on such thorns and play as wantonly   when summers breath their masked buds discloses   but for their virtue only is their show   they live unwood and unrespected fade   die to themselves sweet roses do not so   of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made     and so of you beauteous and lovely youth     when that shall vade by verse distills your truth   not marble nor the gilded monuments   of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme   but you shall shine more bright in these contents   than unswept stone besmeard with sluttish time   when wasteful war shall statues overturn   and broils root out the work of masonry   nor mars his sword nor wars quick fire shall burn   the living record of your memory   gainst death and alloblivious enmity   shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room   even in the eyes of all posterity   that wear this world out to the ending doom     so till the judgment that yourself arise     you live in this and dwell in lovers eyes   sweet love renew thy force be it not said   thy edge should blunter be than appetite   which but today by feeding is allayd   tomorrow sharpened in his former might   so love be thou although today thou fill   thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fulness   tomorrow see again and do not kill   the spirit of love with a perpetual dulness   let this sad interim like the ocean be   which parts the shore where two contracted new   come daily to the banks that when they see   return of love more blest may be the view     or call it winter which being full of care     makes summers welcome thrice more wished more rare   being your slave what should i do but tend   upon the hours and times of your desire   i have no precious time at all to spend   nor services to do till you require   nor dare i chide the worldwithoutend hour   whilst i my sovereign watch the clock for you   nor think the bitterness of absence sour   when you have bid your servant once adieu   nor dare i question with my jealous thought   where you may be or your affairs suppose   but like a sad slave stay and think of nought   save where you are how happy you make those     so true a fool is love that in your will     though you do anything he thinks no ill   that god forbid that made me first your slave   i should in thought control your times of pleasure   or at your hand the account of hours to crave   being your vassal bound to stay your leisure   o let me suffer being at your beck   the imprisond absence of your liberty   and patience tame to sufferance bide each check   without accusing you of injury   be where you list your charter is so strong   that you yourself may privilage your time   to what you will to you it doth belong   yourself to pardon of selfdoing crime     i am to wait though waiting so be hell     not blame your pleasure be it ill or well   if there be nothing new but that which is   hath been before how are our brains beguild   which labouring for invention bear amiss   the second burthen of a former child   o that record could with a backward look   even of five hundred courses of the sun   show me your image in some antique book   since mind at first in character was done   that i might see what the old world could say   to this composed wonder of your frame   whr we are mended or whr better they   or whether revolution be the same     o sure i am the wits of former days     to subjects worse have given admiring praise   like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore   so do our minutes hasten to their end   each changing place with that which goes before   in sequent toil all forwards do contend   nativity once in the main of light   crawls to maturity wherewith being crownd   crooked eclipses gainst his glory fight   and time that gave doth now his gift confound   time doth transfix the flourish set on youth   and delves the parallels in beautys brow   feeds on the rarities of natures truth   and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow     and yet to times in hope my verse shall stand     praising thy worth despite his cruel hand   is it thy will thy image should keep open   my heavy eyelids to the weary night   dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken   while shadows like to thee do mock my sight   is it thy spirit that thou sendst from thee   so far from home into my deeds to pry   to find out shames and idle hours in me   the scope and tenure of thy jealousy   o no thy love though much is not so great   it is my love that keeps mine eye awake   mine own true love that doth my rest defeat   to play the watchman ever for thy sake     for thee watch i whilst thou dost wake elsewhere     from me far off with others all too near   sin of selflove possesseth all mine eye   and all my soul and all my every part   and for this sin there is no remedy   it is so grounded inward in my heart   methinks no face so gracious is as mine   no shape so true no truth of such account   and for myself mine own worth do define   as i all other in all worths surmount   but when my glass shows me myself indeed   beated and choppd with tanned antiquity   mine own selflove quite contrary i read   self so selfloving were iniquity     tis theemyselfthat for myself i praise     painting my age with beauty of thy days   against my love shall be as i am now   with times injurious hand crushd and oerworn   when hours have draind his blood and filld his brow   with lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn   hath travelld on to ages steepy night   and all those beauties whereof now hes king   are vanishing or vanished out of sight   stealing away the treasure of his spring   for such a time do i now fortify   against confounding ages cruel knife   that he shall never cut from memory   my sweet loves beauty though my lovers life     his beauty shall in these black lines be seen     and they shall live and he in them still green   when i have seen by times fell hand defacd   the richproud cost of outworn buried age   when sometime lofty towers i see downrazd   and brass eternal slave to mortal rage   when i have seen the hungry ocean gain   advantage on the kingdom of the shore   and the firm soil win of the watery main   increasing store with loss and loss with store   when i have seen such interchange of state   or state itself confounded to decay   ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate   that time will come and take my love away     this thought is as a death which cannot choose     but weep to have that which it fears to lose   since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea   but sad mortality oersways their power   how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea   whose action is no stronger than a flower   o how shall summers honey breath hold out   against the wrackful siege of battering days   when rocks impregnable are not so stout   nor gates of steel so strong but time decays   o fearful meditation where alack   shall times best jewel from times chest lie hid   or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back   or who his spoil of beauty can forbid     o none unless this miracle have might     that in black ink my love may still shine bright   tired with all these for restful death i cry   as to behold desert a beggar born   and needy nothing trimmd in jollity   and purest faith unhappily forsworn   and gilded honour shamefully misplacd   and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted   and right perfection wrongfully disgracd   and strength by limping sway disabled   and art made tonguetied by authority   and follydoctorlikecontrolling skill   and simple truth miscalld simplicity   and captive good attending captain ill     tird with all these from these would i be gone     save that to die i leave my love alone   ah wherefore with infection should he live   and with his presence grace impiety   that sin by him advantage should achieve   and lace itself with his society   why should false painting imitate his cheek   and steel dead seeming of his living hue   why should poor beauty indirectly seek   roses of shadow since his rose is true   why should he live now nature bankrupt is   beggard of blood to blush through lively veins   for she hath no exchequer now but his   and proud of many lives upon his gains     o him she stores to show what wealth she had     in days long since before these last so bad   thus is his cheek the map of days outworn   when beauty lived and died as flowers do now   before these bastard signs of fair were born   or durst inhabit on a living brow   before the golden tresses of the dead   the right of sepulchres were shorn away   to live a second life on second head   ere beautys dead fleece made another gay   in him those holy antique hours are seen   without all ornament itself and true   making no summer of anothers green   robbing no old to dress his beauty new     and him as for a map doth nature store     to show false art what beauty was of yore   those parts of thee that the worlds eye doth view   want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend   all tonguesthe voice of soulsgive thee that due   uttering bare truth even so as foes commend   thy outward thus with outward praise is crownd   but those same tongues that give thee so thine own   in other accents do this praise confound   by seeing farther than the eye hath shown   they look into the beauty of thy mind   and that in guess they measure by thy deeds   thenchurlstheir thoughts although their eyes were kind   to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds     but why thy odour matcheth not thy show     the soil is this that thou dost common grow   that thou art blamd shall not be thy defect   for slanders mark was ever yet the fair   the ornament of beauty is suspect   a crow that flies in heavens sweetest air   so thou be good slander doth but approve   thy worth the greater being wood of time   for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love   and thou presentst a pure unstained prime   thou hast passed by the ambush of young days   either not assaild or victor being chargd   yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise   to tie up envy evermore enlargd     if some suspect of ill maskd not thy show     then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe   no longer mourn for me when i am dead   than you shall hear the surly sullen bell   give warning to the world that i am fled   from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell   nay if you read this line remember not   the hand that writ it for i love you so   that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot   if thinking on me then should make you woe   o ifi say you look upon this verse   when i perhaps compounded am with clay   do not so much as my poor name rehearse   but let your love even with my life decay     lest the wise world should look into your moan     and mock you with me after i am gone   o lest the world should task you to recite   what merit lived in me that you should love   after my deathdear love forget me quite   for you in me can nothing worthy prove   unless you would devise some virtuous lie   to do more for me than mine own desert   and hang more praise upon deceased i   than niggard truth would willingly impart   o lest your true love may seem false in this   that you for love speak well of me untrue   my name be buried where my body is   and live no more to shame nor me nor you     for i am shamed by that which i bring forth     and so should you to love things nothing worth   that time of year thou mayst in me behold   when yellow leaves or none or few do hang   upon those boughs which shake against the cold   bare ruind choirs where late the sweet birds sang   in me thou seest the twilight of such day   as after sunset fadeth in the west   which by and by black night doth take away   deaths second self that seals up all in rest   in me thou seest the glowing of such fire   that on the ashes of his youth doth lie   as the deathbed whereon it must expire   consumd with that which it was nourishd by     this thou perceivst which makes thy love more strong     to love that well which thou must leave ere long   but be contented when that fell arrest   without all bail shall carry me away   my life hath in this line some interest   which for memorial still with thee shall stay   when thou reviewest this thou dost review   the very part was consecrate to thee   the earth can have but earth which is his due   my spirit is thine the better part of me   so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life   the prey of worms my body being dead   the coward conquest of a wretchs knife   too base of thee to be remembered     the worth of that is that which it contains     and that is this and this with thee remains   so are you to my thoughts as food to life   or as sweetseasond showers are to the ground   and for the peace of you i hold such strife   as twixt a miser and his wealth is found   now proud as an enjoyer and anon   doubting the filching age will steal his treasure   now counting best to be with you alone   then betterd that the world may see my pleasure   sometime all full with feasting on your sight   and by and by clean starved for a look   possessing or pursuing no delight   save what is had or must from you be took     thus do i pine and surfeit day by day     or gluttoning on all or all away   why is my verse so barren of new pride   so far from variation or quick change   why with the time do i not glance aside   to newfound methods and to compounds strange   why write i still all one ever the same   and keep invention in a noted weed   that every word doth almost tell my name   showing their birth and where they did proceed   o know sweet love i always write of you   and you and love are still my argument   so all my best is dressing old words new   spending again what is already spent     for as the sun is daily new and old     so is my love still telling what is told   thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear   thy dial how thy precious minutes waste   these vacant leaves thy minds imprint will bear   and of this book this learning mayst thou taste   the wrinkles which thy glass will truly show   of mouthed graves will give thee memory   thou by thy dials shady stealth mayst know   times thievish progress to eternity   look what thy memory cannot contain   commit to these waste blanks and thou shalt find   those children nursed deliverd from thy brain   to take a new acquaintance of thy mind     these offices so oft as thou wilt look     shall profit thee and much enrich thy book   so oft have i invoked thee for my muse   and found such fair assistance in my verse   as every alien pen hath got my use   and under thee their poesy disperse   thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing   and heavy ignorance aloft to fly   have added feathers to the learneds wing   and given grace a double majesty   yet be most proud of that which i compile   whose influence is thine and born of thee   in others works thou dost but mend the style   and arts with thy sweet graces graced be     but thou art all my art and dost advance     as high as learning my rude ignorance   whilst i alone did call upon thy aid   my verse alone had all thy gentle grace   but now my gracious numbers are decayd   and my sick muse doth give an other place   i grant sweet love thy lovely argument   deserves the travail of a worthier pen   yet what of thee thy poet doth invent   he robs thee of and pays it thee again   he lends thee virtue and he stole that word   from thy behaviour beauty doth he give   and found it in thy cheek he can afford   no praise to thee but what in thee doth live     then thank him not for that which he doth say     since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay   o how i faint when i of you do write   knowing a better spirit doth use your name   and in the praise thereof spends all his might   to make me tonguetied speaking of your fame   but since your worthwide as the ocean is   the humble as the proudest sail doth bear   my saucy bark inferior far to his   on your broad main doth wilfully appear   your shallowest help will hold me up afloat   whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride   or being wrackd i am a worthless boat   he of tall building and of goodly pride     then if he thrive and i be cast away     the worst was thismy love was my decay   or i shall live your epitaph to make   or you survive when i in earth am rotten   from hence your memory death cannot take   although in me each part will be forgotten   your name from hence immortal life shall have   though i once gone to all the world must die   the earth can yield me but a common grave   when you entombed in mens eyes shall lie   your monument shall be my gentle verse   which eyes not yet created shall oerread   and tongues to be your being shall rehearse   when all the breathers of this world are dead     you still shall livesuch virtue hath my pen     where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men   i grant thou wert not married to my muse   and therefore mayst without attaint oerlook   the dedicated words which writers use   of their fair subject blessing every book   thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue   finding thy worth a limit past my praise   and therefore art enforced to seek anew   some fresher stamp of the timebettering days   and do so love yet when they have devisd   what strained touches rhetoric can lend   thou truly fair wert truly sympathizd   in true plain words by thy truetelling friend     and their gross painting might be better usd     where cheeks need blood in thee it is abusd   i never saw that you did painting need   and therefore to your fair no painting set   i found or thought i found you did exceed   that barren tender of a poets debt   and therefore have i slept in your report   that you yourself being extant well might show   how far a modern quill doth come too short   speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow   this silence for my sin you did impute   which shall be most my glory being dumb   for i impair not beauty being mute   when others would give life and bring a tomb     there lives more life in one of your fair eyes     than both your poets can in praise devise   who is it that says most which can say more   than this rich praisethat you alone are you   in whose confine immured is the store   which should example where your equal grew   lean penury within that pen doth dwell   that to his subject lends not some small glory   but he that writes of you if he can tell   that you are you so dignifies his story   let him but copy what in you is writ   not making worse what nature made so clear   and such a counterpart shall fame his wit   making his style admired every where     you to your beauteous blessings add a curse     being fond on praise which makes your praises worse   my tonguetied muse in manners holds her still   while comments of your praise richly compild   reserve their character with golden quill   and precious phrase by all the muses fild   i think good thoughts whilst others write good words   and like unlettered clerk still cry amen   to every hymn that able spirit affords   in polishd form of wellrefined pen   hearing you praised i say tis so tis true   and to the most of praise add something more   but that is in my thought whose love to you   though words come hindmost holds his rank before     then others for the breath of words respect     me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect   was it the proud full sail of his great verse   bound for the prize of all too precious you   that did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse   making their tomb the womb wherein they grew   was it his spirit by spirits taught to write   above a mortal pitch that struck me dead   no neither he nor his compeers by night   giving him aid my verse astonished   he nor that affable familiar ghost   which nightly gulls him with intelligence   as victors of my silence cannot boast   i was not sick of any fear from thence     but when your countenance filld up his line     then lacked i matter that enfeebled mine   farewell thou art too dear for my possessing   and like enough thou knowst thy estimate   the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing   my bonds in thee are all determinate   for how do i hold thee but by thy granting   and for that riches where is my deserving   the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting   and so my patent back again is swerving   thy self thou gavst thy own worth then not knowing   or me to whom thou gavst it else mistaking   so thy great gift upon misprision growing   comes home again on better judgement making     thus have i had thee as a dream doth flatter     in sleep a king but waking no such matter   lxxxviii   when thou shalt be disposd to set me light   and place my merit in the eye of scorn   upon thy side against myself ill fight   and prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn   with mine own weakness being best acquainted   upon thy part i can set down a story   of faults conceald wherein i am attainted   that thou in losing me shalt win much glory   and i by this will be a gainer too   for bending all my loving thoughts on thee   the injuries that to myself i do   doing thee vantage doublevantage me     such is my love to thee i so belong     that for thy right myself will bear all wrong   say that thou didst forsake me for some fault   and i will comment upon that offence   speak of my lameness and i straight will halt   against thy reasons making no defence   thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill   to set a form upon desired change   as ill myself disgrace knowing thy will   i will acquaintance strangle and look strange   be absent from thy walks and in my tongue   thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell   lest i too much profane should do it wrong   and haply of our old acquaintance tell     for thee against my self ill vow debate     for i must neer love him whom thou dost hate   then hate me when thou wilt if ever now   now while the world is bent my deeds to cross   join with the spite of fortune make me bow   and do not drop in for an afterloss   ah do not when my heart hath scapd this sorrow   come in the rearward of a conquerd woe   give not a windy night a rainy morrow   to linger out a purposd overthrow   if thou wilt leave me do not leave me last   when other petty griefs have done their spite   but in the onset come so shall i taste   at first the very worst of fortunes might     and other strains of woe which now seem woe     compard with loss of thee will not seem so   some glory in their birth some in their skill   some in their wealth some in their bodys force   some in their garments though newfangled ill   some in their hawks and hounds some in their horse   and every humour hath his adjunct pleasure   wherein it finds a joy above the rest   but these particulars are not my measure   all these i better in one general best   thy love is better than high birth to me   richer than wealth prouder than garments costs   of more delight than hawks and horses be   and having thee of all mens pride i boast     wretched in this alone that thou mayst take     all this away and me most wretchcd make   but do thy worst to steal thyself away   for term of life thou art assured mine   and life no longer than thy love will stay   for it depends upon that love of thine   then need i not to fear the worst of wrongs   when in the least of them my life hath end   i see a better state to me belongs   than that which on thy humour doth depend   thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind   since that my life on thy revolt doth lie   o what a happy title do i find   happy to have thy love happy to die     but whats so blessedfair that fears no blot     thou mayst be false and yet i know it not   so shall i live supposing thou art true   like a deceived husband so loves face   may still seem love to me though alterd new   thy looks with me thy heart in other place   for there can live no hatred in thine eye   therefore in that i cannot know thy change   in manys looks the false hearts history   is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange   but heaven in thy creation did decree   that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell   whateer thy thoughts or thy hearts workings be   thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell     how like eves apple doth thy beauty grow     if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show   they that have power to hurt and will do none   that do not do the thing they most do show   who moving others are themselves as stone   unmoved cold and to temptation slow   they rightly do inherit heavens graces   and husband natures riches from expense   they are the lords and owners of their faces   others but stewards of their excellence   the summers flower is to the summer sweet   though to itself it only live and die   but if that flower with base infection meet   the basest weed outbraves his dignity     for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds     lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds   how sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame   which like a canker in the fragrant rose   doth spot the beauty of thy budding name   o in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose   that tongue that tells the story of thy days   making lascivious comments on thy sport   cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise   naming thy name blesses an ill report   o what a mansion have those vices got   which for their habitation chose out thee   where beautys veil doth cover every blot   and all things turns to fair that eyes can see     take heed dear heart of this large privilege     the hardest knife illusd doth lose his edge   some say thy fault is youth some wantonness   some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport   both grace and faults are lovd of more and less   thou makst faults graces that to thee resort   as on the finger of a throned queen   the basest jewel will be well esteemd   so are those errors that in thee are seen   to truths translated and for true things deemd   how many lambs might the stern wolf betray   if like a lamb he could his looks translate   how many gazers mightst thou lead away   if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state     but do not so i love thee in such sort     as thou being mine mine is thy good report   how like a winter hath my absence been   from thee the pleasure of the fleeting year   what freezings have i felt what dark days seen   what old decembers bareness everywhere   and yet this time removed was summers time   the teeming autumn big with rich increase   bearing the wanton burden of the prime   like widowd wombs after their lords decease   yet this abundant issue seemd to me   but hope of orphans and unfatherd fruit   for summer and his pleasures wait on thee   and thou away the very birds are mute     or if they sing tis with so dull a cheer     that leaves look pale dreading the winters near   from you have i been absent in the spring   when proudpied april dressd in all his trim   hath put a spirit of youth in every thing   that heavy saturn laughd and leapd with him   yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell   of different flowers in odour and in hue   could make me any summers story tell   or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew   nor did i wonder at the lilys white   nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose   they were but sweet but figures of delight   drawn after you you pattern of all those     yet seemd it winter still and you away     as with your shadow i with these did play   the forward violet thus did i chide   sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells   if not from my loves breath the purple pride   which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells   in my loves veins thou hast too grossly dyd   the lily i condemned for thy hand   and buds of marjoram had stoln thy hair   the roses fearfully on thorns did stand   one blushing shame another white despair   a third nor red nor white had stoln of both   and to his robbery had annexd thy breath   but for his theft in pride of all his growth   a vengeful canker eat him up to death     more flowers i noted yet i none could see     but sweet or colour it had stoln from thee   where art thou muse that thou forgetst so long   to speak of that which gives thee all thy might   spendst thou thy fury on some worthless song   darkening thy power to lend base subjects light   return forgetful muse and straight redeem   in gentle numbers time so idly spent   sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem   and gives thy pen both skill and argument   rise resty muse my loves sweet face survey   if time have any wrinkle graven there   if any be a satire to decay   and make times spoils despised every where     give my love fame faster than time wastes life     so thou preventst his scythe and crooked knife   o truant muse what shall be thy amends   for thy neglect of truth in beauty dyd   both truth and beauty on my love depends   so dost thou too and therein dignified   make answer muse wilt thou not haply say   truth needs no colour with his colour fixd   beauty no pencil beautys truth to lay   but best is best if never intermixd   because he needs no praise wilt thou be dumb   excuse not silence so fort lies in thee   to make him much outlive a gilded tomb   and to be praisd of ages yet to be     then do thy office muse i teach thee how     to make him seem long hence as he shows now   my love is strengthend though more weak in seeming   i love not less though less the show appear   that love is merchandizd whose rich esteeming   the owners tongue doth publish every where   our love was new and then but in the spring   when i was wont to greet it with my lays   as philomel in summers front doth sing   and stops her pipe in growth of riper days   not that the summer is less pleasant now   than when her mournful hymns did hush the night   but that wild music burthens every bough   and sweets grown common lose their dear delight     therefore like her i sometime hold my tongue     because i would not dull you with my song   alack what poverty my muse brings forth   that having such a scope to show her pride   the argument all bare is of more worth   than when it hath my added praise beside   o blame me not if i no more can write   look in your glass and there appears a face   that overgoes my blunt invention quite   dulling my lines and doing me disgrace   were it not sinful then striving to mend   to mar the subject that before was well   for to no other pass my verses tend   than of your graces and your gifts to tell     and more much more than in my verse can sit     your own glass shows you when you look in it   to me fair friend you never can be old   for as you were when first your eye i eyd   such seems your beauty still three winters cold   have from the forests shook three summers pride   three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turnd   in process of the seasons have i seen   three april perfumes in three hot junes burnd   since first i saw you fresh which yet are green   ah yet doth beauty like a dialhand   steal from his figure and no pace perceivd   so your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand   hath motion and mine eye may be deceivd     for fear of which hear this thou age unbred     ere you were born was beautys summer dead   let not my love be calld idolatry   nor my beloved as an idol show   since all alike my songs and praises be   to one of one still such and ever so   kind is my love today tomorrow kind   still constant in a wondrous excellence   therefore my verse to constancy confind   one thing expressing leaves out difference   fair kind and true is all my argument   fair kind and true varying to other words   and in this change is my invention spent   three themes in one which wondrous scope affords     fair kind and true have often livd alone     which three till now never kept seat in one   when in the chronicle of wasted time   i see descriptions of the fairest wights   and beauty making beautiful old rime   in praise of ladies dead and lovely knights   then in the blazon of sweet beautys best   of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow   i see their antique pen would have expressd   even such a beauty as you master now   so all their praises are but prophecies   of this our time all you prefiguring   and for they looked but with divining eyes   they had not skill enough your worth to sing     for we which now behold these present days     have eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise   not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul   of the wide world dreaming on things to come   can yet the lease of my true love control   supposed as forfeit to a confind doom   the mortal moon hath her eclipse endurd   and the sad augurs mock their own presage   incertainties now crown themselves assurd   and peace proclaims olives of endless age   now with the drops of this most balmy time   my love looks fresh and death to me subscribes   since spite of him ill live in this poor rime   while he insults oer dull and speechless tribes     and thou in this shalt find thy monument     when tyrants crests and tombs of brass are spent   whats in the brain that ink may character   which hath not figurd to thee my true spirit   whats new to speak what now to register   that may express my love or thy dear merit   nothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divine   i must each day say oer the very same   counting no old thing old thou mine i thine   even as when first i hallowd thy fair name   so that eternal love in loves fresh case   weighs not the dust and injury of age   nor gives to necessary wrinkles place   but makes antiquity for aye his page     finding the first conceit of love there bred     where time and outward form would show it dead   o never say that i was false of heart   though absence seemd my flame to qualify   as easy might i from my self depart   as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie   that is my home of love if i have rangd   like him that travels i return again   just to the time not with the time exchangd   so that myself bring water for my stain   never believe though in my nature reignd   all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood   that it could so preposterously be staind   to leave for nothing all thy sum of good     for nothing this wide universe i call     save thou my rose in it thou art my all   alas tis true i have gone here and there   and made my self a motley to the view   gord mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most dear   made old offences of affections new   most true it is that i have lookd on truth   askance and strangely but by all above   these blenches gave my heart another youth   and worse essays provd thee my best of love   now all is done save what shall have no end   mine appetite i never more will grind   on newer proof to try an older friend   a god in love to whom i am confind     then give me welcome next my heaven the best     even to thy pure and most most loving breast   o for my sake do you with fortune chide   the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds   that did not better for my life provide   than public means which public manners breeds   thence comes it that my name receives a brand   and almost thence my nature is subdud   to what it works in like the dyers hand   pity me then and wish i were renewd   whilst like a willing patient i will drink   potions of eisel gainst my strong infection   no bitterness that i will bitter think   nor double penance to correct correction     pity me then dear friend and i assure ye     even that your pity is enough to cure me   your love and pity doth the impression fill   which vulgar scandal stampd upon my brow   for what care i who calls me well or ill   so you oergreen my bad my good allow   you are my alltheworld and i must strive   to know my shames and praises from your tongue   none else to me nor i to none alive   that my steeld sense or changes right or wrong   in so profound abysm i throw all care   of others voices that my adders sense   to critic and to flatterer stopped are   mark how with my neglect i do dispense     you are so strongly in my purpose bred     that all the world besides methinks are dead   since i left you mine eye is in my mind   and that which governs me to go about   doth part his function and is partly blind   seems seeing but effectually is out   for it no form delivers to the heart   of bird of flower or shape which it doth latch   of his quick objects hath the mind no part   nor his own vision holds what it doth catch   for if it see the rudst or gentlest sight   the most sweet favour or deformedst creature   the mountain or the sea the day or night   the crow or dove it shapes them to your feature     incapable of more replete with you     my most true mind thus maketh mine untrue   or whether doth my mind being crownd with you   drink up the monarchs plague this flattery   or whether shall i say mine eye saith true   and that your love taught it this alchemy   to make of monsters and things indigest   such cherubins as your sweet self resemble   creating every bad a perfect best   as fast as objects to his beams assemble   o tis the first tis flattery in my seeing   and my great mind most kingly drinks it up   mine eye well knows what with his gust is greeing   and to his palate doth prepare the cup     if it be poisond tis the lesser sin     that mine eye loves it and doth first begin   those lines that i before have writ do lie   even those that said i could not love you dearer   yet then my judgment knew no reason why   my most full flame should afterwards burn clearer   but reckoning time whose milliond accidents   creep in twixt vows and change decrees of kings   tan sacred beauty blunt the sharpst intents   divert strong minds to the course of altering things   alas why fearing of times tyranny   might i not then say now i love you best   when i was certain oer incertainty   crowning the present doubting of the rest     love is a babe then might i not say so     to give full growth to that which still doth grow   let me not to the marriage of true minds   admit impediments love is not love   which alters when it alteration finds   or bends with the remover to remove   o no it is an everfixed mark   that looks on tempests and is never shaken   it is the star to every wandering bark   whose worths unknown although his height be taken   loves not times fool though rosy lips and cheeks   within his bending sickles compass come   love alters not with his brief hours and weeks   but bears it out even to the edge of doom     if this be error and upon me provd     i never writ nor no man ever lovd   accuse me thus that i have scanted all   wherein i should your great deserts repay   forgot upon your dearest love to call   whereto all bonds do tie me day by day   that i have frequent been with unknown minds   and given to time your own dearpurchasd right   that i have hoisted sail to all the winds   which should transport me farthest from your sight   book both my wilfulness and errors down   and on just proof surmise accumulate   bring me within the level of your frown   but shoot not at me in your wakend hate     since my appeal says i did strive to prove     the constancy and virtue of your love   like as to make our appetite more keen   with eager compounds we our palate urge   as to prevent our maladies unseen   we sicken to shun sickness when we purge   even so being full of your neercloying sweetness   to bitter sauces did i frame my feeding   and sick of welfare found a kind of meetness   to be diseasd ere that there was true needing   thus policy in love to anticipate   the ills that were not grew to faults assurd   and brought to medicine a healthful state   which rank of goodness would by ill be curd     but thence i learn and find the lesson true     drugs poison him that so fell sick of you   what potions have i drunk of siren tears   distilld from limbecks foul as hell within   applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears   still losing when i saw myself to win   what wretched errors hath my heart committed   whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never   how have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted   in the distraction of this madding fever   o benefit of ill now i find true   that better is by evil still made better   and ruind love when it is built anew   grows fairer than at first more strong far greater     so i return rebukd to my content     and gain by ill thrice more than i have spent   that you were once unkind befriends me now   and for that sorrow which i then did feel   needs must i under my transgression bow   unless my nerves were brass or hammerd steel   for if you were by my unkindness shaken   as i by yours youve passd a hell of time   and i a tyrant have no leisure taken   to weigh how once i sufferd in your crime   o that our night of woe might have rememberd   my deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits   and soon to you as you to me then tenderd   the humble salve which wounded bosoms fits     but that your trespass now becomes a fee     mine ransoms yours and yours must ransom me   tis better to be vile than vile esteemd   when not to be receives reproach of being   and the just pleasure lost which is so deemd   not by our feeling but by others seeing   for why should others false adulterate eyes   give salutation to my sportive blood   or on my frailties why are frailer spies   which in their wills count bad what i think good   no i am that i am and they that level   at my abuses reckon up their own   i may be straight though they themselves be bevel   by their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown     unless this general evil they maintain     all men are bad and in their badness reign   thy gift thy tables are within my brain   full characterd with lasting memory   which shall above that idle rank remain   beyond all date even to eternity   or at the least so long as brain and heart   have faculty by nature to subsist   till each to razd oblivion yield his part   of thee thy record never can be missd   that poor retention could not so much hold   nor need i tallies thy dear love to score   therefore to give them from me was i bold   to trust those tables that receive thee more     to keep an adjunct to remember thee     were to import forgetfulness in me   no time thou shalt not boast that i do change   thy pyramids built up with newer might   to me are nothing novel nothing strange   they are but dressings of a former sight   our dates are brief and therefore we admire   what thou dost foist upon us that is old   and rather make them born to our desire   than think that we before have heard them told   thy registers and thee i both defy   not wondering at the present nor the past   for thy records and what we see doth lie   made more or less by thy continual haste     this i do vow and this shall ever be     i will be true despite thy scythe and thee   if my dear love were but the child of state   it might for fortunes bastard be unfatherd   as subject to times love or to times hate   weeds among weeds or flowers with flowers gatherd   no it was builded far from accident   it suffers not in smiling pomp nor falls   under the blow of thralled discontent   whereto th inviting time our fashion calls   it fears not policy that heretic   which works on leases of shortnumberd hours   but all alone stands hugely politic   that it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers     to this i witness call the fools of time     which die for goodness who have lived for crime   weret aught to me i bore the canopy   with my extern the outward honouring   or laid great bases for eternity   which proves more short than waste or ruining   have i not seen dwellers on form and favour   lose all and more by paying too much rent   for compound sweet forgoing simple savour   pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent   no let me be obsequious in thy heart   and take thou my oblation poor but free   which is not mixd with seconds knows no art   but mutual render only me for thee     hence thou suborned informer a true soul     when most impeachd stands least in thy control   o thou my lovely boy who in thy power   dost hold times fickle glass his fickle hour   who hast by waning grown and therein showst   thy lovers withering as thy sweet self growst   if nature sovereign mistress over wrack   as thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back   she keeps thee to this purpose that her skill   may time disgrace and wretched minutes kill   yet fear her o thou minion of her pleasure   she may detain but not still keep her treasure     her audit though delayed answered must be     and her quietus is to render thee   in the old age black was not counted fair   or if it were it bore not beautys name   but now is black beautys successive heir   and beauty slanderd with a bastard shame   for since each hand hath put on natures power   fairing the foul with arts false borrowed face   sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower   but is profand if not lives in disgrace   therefore my mistress eyes are raven black   her eyes so suited and they mourners seem   at such who not born fair no beauty lack   slandring creation with a false esteem     yet so they mourn becoming of their woe     that every tongue says beauty should look so   how oft when thou my music music playst   upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds   with thy sweet fingers when thou gently swayst   the wiry concord that mine ear confounds   do i envy those jacks that nimble leap   to kiss the tender inward of thy hand   whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap   at the woods boldness by thee blushing stand   to be so tickled they would change their state   and situation with those dancing chips   oer whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait   making dead wood more blessd than living lips     since saucy jacks so happy are in this     give them thy fingers me thy lips to kiss   the expense of spirit in a waste of shame   is lust in action and till action lust   is perjurd murderous bloody full of blame   savage extreme rude cruel not to trust   enjoyd no sooner but despised straight   past reason hunted and no sooner had   past reason hated as a swallowd bait   on purpose laid to make the taker mad   mad in pursuit and in possession so   had having and in quest to have extreme   a bliss in proof and provd a very woe   before a joy proposd behind a dream     all this the world well knows yet none knows well     to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell   my mistress eyes are nothing like the sun   coral is far more red than her lips red   if snow be white why then her breasts are dun   if hairs be wires black wires grow on her head   i have seen roses damaskd red and white   but no such roses see i in her cheeks   and in some perfumes is there more delight   than in the breath that from my mistress reeks   i love to hear her speak yet well i know   that music hath a far more pleasing sound   i grant i never saw a goddess go   my mistress when she walks treads on the ground     and yet by heaven i think my love as rare     as any she belied with false compare   thou art as tyrannous so as thou art   as those whose beauties proudly make them cruel   for well thou knowst to my dear doting heart   thou art the fairest and most precious jewel   yet in good faith some say that thee behold   thy face hath not the power to make love groan   to say they err i dare not be so bold   although i swear it to myself alone   and to be sure that is not false i swear   a thousand groans but thinking on thy face   one on anothers neck do witness bear   thy black is fairest in my judgments place     in nothing art thou black save in thy deeds     and thence this slander as i think proceeds   thine eyes i love and they as pitying me   knowing thy heart torment me with disdain   have put on black and loving mourners be   looking with pretty ruth upon my pain   and truly not the morning sun of heaven   better becomes the grey cheeks of the east   nor that full star that ushers in the even   doth half that glory to the sober west   as those two mourning eyes become thy face   o let it then as well beseem thy heart   to mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace   and suit thy pity like in every part     then will i swear beauty herself is black     and all they foul that thy complexion lack   beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan   for that deep wound it gives my friend and me   ist not enough to torture me alone   but slave to slavery my sweetst friend must be   me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken   and my next self thou harder hast engrossd   of him myself and thee i am forsaken   a torment thrice threefold thus to be crossd   prison my heart in thy steel bosoms ward   but then my friends heart let my poor heart bail   whoeer keeps me let my heart be his guard   thou canst not then use rigour in my jail     and yet thou wilt for i being pent in thee     perforce am thine and all that is in me   so now i have confessd that he is thine   and i my self am mortgagd to thy will   myself ill forfeit so that other mine   thou wilt restore to be my comfort still   but thou wilt not nor he will not be free   for thou art covetous and he is kind   he learnd but suretylike to write for me   under that bond that him as fast doth bind   the statute of thy beauty thou wilt take   thou usurer that puttst forth all to use   and sue a friend came debtor for my sake   so him i lose through my unkind abuse     him have i lost thou hast both him and me     he pays the whole and yet am i not free   whoever hath her wish thou hast thy will   and will to boot and will in overplus   more than enough am i that vexd thee still   to thy sweet will making addition thus   wilt thou whose will is large and spacious   not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine   shall will in others seem right gracious   and in my will no fair acceptance shine   the sea all water yet receives rain still   and in abundance addeth to his store   so thou being rich in will add to thy will   one will of mine to make thy large will more     let no unkind no fair beseechers kill     think all but one and me in that one will   if thy soul check thee that i come so near   swear to thy blind soul that i was thy will   and will thy soul knows is admitted there   thus far for love my lovesuit sweet fulfil   will will fulfil the treasure of thy love   ay fill it full with wills and my will one   in things of great receipt with ease we prove   among a number one is reckond none   then in the number let me pass untold   though in thy stores account i one must be   for nothing hold me so it please thee hold   that nothing me a something sweet to thee     make but my name thy love and love that still     and then thou lovst me for my name is will   thou blind fool love what dost thou to mine eyes   that they behold and see not what they see   they know what beauty is see where it lies   yet what the best is take the worst to be   if eyes corrupt by overpartial looks   be anchord in the bay where all men ride   why of eyes falsehood hast thou forged hooks   whereto the judgment of my heart is tied   why should my heart think that a several plot   which my heart knows the wide worlds common place   or mine eyes seeing this say this is not   to put fair truth upon so foul a face     in things right true my heart and eyes have errd     and to this false plague are they now transferrd   cxxxviii   when my love swears that she is made of truth   i do believe her though i know she lies   that she might think me some untutord youth   unlearned in the worlds false subtleties   thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young   although she knows my days are past the best   simply i credit her falsespeaking tongue   on both sides thus is simple truth suppressed   but wherefore says she not she is unjust   and wherefore say not i that i am old   o loves best habit is in seeming trust   and age in love loves not to have years told     therefore i lie with her and she with me     and in our faults by lies we flatterd be   o call not me to justify the wrong   that thy unkindness lays upon my heart   wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue   use power with power and slay me not by art   tell me thou lovst elsewhere but in my sight   dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside   what needst thou wound with cunning when thy might   is more than my oerpressd defence can bide   let me excuse thee ah my love well knows   her pretty looks have been mine enemies   and therefore from my face she turns my foes   that they elsewhere might dart their injuries     yet do not so but since i am near slain     kill me outright with looks and rid my pain   be wise as thou art cruel do not press   my tonguetied patience with too much disdain   lest sorrow lend me words and words express   the manner of my pitywanting pain   if i might teach thee wit better it were   though not to love yet love to tell me so   as testy sick men when their deaths be near   no news but health from their physicians know   for if i should despair i should grow mad   and in my madness might speak ill of thee   now this illwresting world is grown so bad   mad slanderers by mad ears believed be     that i may not be so nor thou belied     bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide   in faith i do not love thee with mine eyes   for they in thee a thousand errors note   but tis my heart that loves what they despise   who in despite of view is pleased to dote   nor are mine ears with thy tongues tune delighted   nor tender feeling to base touches prone   nor taste nor smell desire to be invited   to any sensual feast with thee alone   but my five wits nor my five senses can   dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee   who leaves unswayd the likeness of a man   thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be     only my plague thus far i count my gain     that she that makes me sin awards me pain   love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate   hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving   o but with mine compare thou thine own state   and thou shalt find it merits not reproving   or if it do not from those lips of thine   that have profand their scarlet ornaments   and seald false bonds of love as oft as mine   robbd others beds revenues of their rents   be it lawful i love thee as thou lovst those   whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee   root pity in thy heart that when it grows   thy pity may deserve to pitied be     if thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide     by selfexample mayst thou be denied   lo as a careful housewife runs to catch   one of her featherd creatures broke away   sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch   in pursuit of the thing she would have stay   whilst her neglected child holds her in chase   cries to catch her whose busy care is bent   to follow that which flies before her face   not prizing her poor infants discontent   so runnst thou after that which flies from thee   whilst i thy babe chase thee afar behind   but if thou catch thy hope turn back to me   and play the mothers part kiss me be kind     so will i pray that thou mayst have thy will     if thou turn back and my loud crying still   two loves i have of comfort and despair   which like two spirits do suggest me still   the better angel is a man right fair   the worser spirit a woman colourd ill   to win me soon to hell my female evil   tempteth my better angel from my side   and would corrupt my saint to be a devil   wooing his purity with her foul pride   and whether that my angel be turnd fiend   suspect i may yet not directly tell   but being both from me both to each friend   i guess one angel in anothers hell     yet this shall i neer know but live in doubt     till my bad angel fire my good one out   those lips that loves own hand did make   breathed forth the sound that said i hate   to me that languishd for her sake   but when she saw my woeful state   straight in her heart did mercy come   chiding that tongue that ever sweet   was usd in giving gentle doom   and taught it thus anew to greet   i hate she alterd with an end   that followed it as gentle day   doth follow night who like a fiend   from heaven to hell is flown away     i hate from hate away she threw     and savd my life saying not you   poor soul the centre of my sinful earth   my sinful earth these rebel powers array   why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth   painting thy outward walls so costly gay   why so large cost having so short a lease   dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend   shall worms inheritors of this excess   eat up thy charge is this thy bodys end   then soul live thou upon thy servants loss   and let that pine to aggravate thy store   buy terms divine in selling hours of dross   within be fed without be rich no more     so shall thou feed on death that feeds on men     and death once dead theres no more dying then   my love is as a fever longing still   for that which longer nurseth the disease   feeding on that which doth preserve the ill   the uncertain sickly appetite to please   my reason the physician to my love   angry that his prescriptions are not kept   hath left me and i desperate now approve   desire is death which physic did except   past cure i am now reason is past care   and franticmad with evermore unrest   my thoughts and my discourse as madmens are   at random from the truth vainly expressd     for i have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright     who art as black as hell as dark as night   o me what eyes hath love put in my head   which have no correspondence with true sight   or if they have where is my judgment fled   that censures falsely what they see aright   if that be fair whereon my false eyes dote   what means the world to say it is not so   if it be not then love doth well denote   loves eye is not so true as all mens no   how can it o how can loves eye be true   that is so vexed with watching and with tears   no marvel then though i mistake my view   the sun itself sees not till heaven clears     o cunning love with tears thou keepst me blind     lest eyes wellseeing thy foul faults should find   canst thou o cruel say i love thee not   when i against myself with thee partake   do i not think on thee when i forgot   am of my self all tyrant for thy sake   who hateth thee that i do call my friend   on whom frownst thou that i do fawn upon   nay if thou lourst on me do i not spend   revenge upon myself with present moan   what merit do i in my self respect   that is so proud thy service to despise   when all my best doth worship

with insufficiency my heart to sway   to make me give the lie to my true sight   and swear that brightness doth not grace the day   whence hast thou this becoming of things ill   that in the very refuse of thy deeds   there is such strength and warrantise of skill   that in my mind thy worst all best exceeds   who taught thee how to make me love thee more   the more i hear and see just cause of hate   o though i love what others do abhor   with others thou shouldst not abhor my state     if thy unworthiness raisd love in me     more worthy i to be belovd of thee   love is too young to know what conscience is   yet who knows not conscience is born of love   then gentle cheater urge not my amiss   lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove   for thou betraying me i do betray   my nobler part to my gross bodys treason   my soul doth tell my body that he may   triumph in love flesh stays no farther reason   but rising at thy name doth point out thee   as his triumphant prize proud of this pride   he is contented thy poor drudge to be   to stand in thy affairs fall by thy side     no want of conscience hold it that i call     her love for whose dear love i rise and fall   in loving thee thou knowst i am forsworn   but thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing   in act thy bedvow broke and new faith torn   in vowing new hate after new love bearing   but why of two oaths breach do i accuse thee   when i break twenty i am perjurd most   for all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee   and all my honest faith in thee is lost   for i have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness   oaths of thy love thy truth thy constancy   and to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness   or made them swear against the thing they see     for i have sworn thee fair more perjurd i     to swear against the truth so foul a lie   cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep   a maid of dians this advantage found   and his lovekindling fire did quickly steep   in a cold valleyfountain of that

tripping by but in her maiden hand   the fairest votary took up that fire   which many legions of true hearts had warmd   and so the general of hot desire   was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmd
